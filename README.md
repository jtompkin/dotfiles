# dotfiles

I don't know how any of this works, I just use Nix to look smart.

The basic framework is based off of 
[nmasur's dotfiles](https://github.com/nmasur/dotfiles/tree/master). I would recommend
looking there for examples and documentation, as their configuration is probably more
applicaple and tweakable than this, but there might be something helpful here :).
